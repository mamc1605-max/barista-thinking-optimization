Systems thinking is a way of understanding messy real-world problems by focusing less on isolated events and more on the underlying structures that repeatedly generate those events. In an introductory presentation, the most useful “entry point” is the stock-and-flow perspective, because it forces you to ask a deceptively simple question: what is accumulating, and what is changing that accumulation over time? Once you can answer that, you can begin to explain patterns—growth, collapse, oscillation, overshoot—without relying on ad hoc stories.

A stock is any quantity that can be measured at a point in time and can accumulate or deplete. Stocks are the system’s “state.” Examples include: cash in a bank account, inventory in a warehouse, students enrolled in a program, atmospheric CO₂ concentration, trust in an institution, or backlog in a customer support queue. Stocks are typically measured in units like dollars, items, people, parts per million, or “cases.” Stocks matter because they embody history: what you see today is the result of what flowed in and out yesterday.

A flow is a rate of change that increases or decreases a stock. Flows are measured per unit time: dollars/day, items/week, people/semester, ppm/year. In a bank account, deposits and withdrawals are flows that change the cash balance (the stock). In inventory, production and shipments are flows that change on-hand units. In population, births and deaths are flows that change population size. This distinction is not just definitional—most policy mistakes happen when people treat a flow problem as if it were a stock problem (or vice versa). For example, reducing monthly expenses (a flow) will not fix an already dangerous level of debt (a stock) unless the flow change is sustained long enough to reduce the stock.

A stock-and-flow diagram makes these relationships explicit. Visually, stocks are drawn as rectangles, flows as thick arrows with valves, and auxiliary variables (like “demand,” “interest rate,” or “staffing”) as converters feeding into flows. The diagram disciplines your thinking in three ways: (1) you must name the stock(s) that represent “what’s really changing,” (2) you must identify the inflows and outflows that govern them, and (3) you must maintain consistent units, which prevents hand-wavy causal claims.

Stocks and flows also reveal why systems can behave counterintuitively. Because stocks integrate flows over time, they create inertia. If a bathtub is half full, turning down the faucet does not instantly lower the water level; the level changes only as net flow becomes negative. This “bathtub logic” is central in domains like climate policy (emissions are flows; atmospheric concentration is a stock), organizational capacity (hiring/training are inflows to workforce skill; attrition is an outflow), and public health (infection prevalence is a stock; transmission and recovery are flows). People often respond to worsening outcomes by changing policies that affect flows, then misinterpret the lagged response as policy failure.

That brings in delays, which are among the most important “etc.” in an intro talk. Delays can occur in information (we observe the stock late), in decision-making (approval cycles), or in physical processes (training time, shipping time, biological incubation). Delays are not just annoying—they can create oscillations and overshoot. For instance, if a company hires aggressively to reduce a service backlog but new staff take months to become productive, managers may continue hiring based on outdated backlog signals, eventually overshooting and causing layoffs later. Stock-and-flow diagrams help you locate where delays sit and predict the kinds of dynamics they produce.

Next are feedback loops, which connect stocks and flows into self-reinforcing patterns. A reinforcing loop amplifies change (more leads → more sales → more referrals → more leads). A balancing loop resists change (higher inventory → more shipments → lower inventory). In stock-and-flow terms, loops work by altering flows based on the current level of stocks or perceived gaps between desired and actual stocks. Many real systems contain multiple loops operating simultaneously, and the dominant loop can shift over time—explaining why interventions work briefly, then stop working.

A helpful distinction for beginners is between causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock-and-flow models. CLDs are great for brainstorming feedback structure, but they can hide accumulation. Stock-and-flow models force conservation and accounting: a stock changes only through its flows, and every flow has a unit and a direction. In practice, I treat CLDs as the “concept map” and stock-and-flow as the “engine blueprint.” If you want to simulate or rigorously argue about dynamics, you usually need the stock-and-flow representation.

Finally, an intro presentation should connect these tools to leverage points—places where a small change can produce large shifts in behavior. Stock-and-flow thinking often highlights leverage by showing (a) which flow dominates a stock’s trajectory, (b) which feedback loop is driving growth or decline, and (c) where delays or information distort decisions. Sometimes leverage is a parameter tweak (reduce churn), but often it is structural (change the feedback, shorten the delay, improve measurement, redefine the goal).

If I had to summarize the “stocks and flows etc.” message in one line for an audience: events are the surface, stocks are the memory, flows are the mechanisms, feedback loops are the engines, and delays are the reason systems surprise us. That framing sets up an intro presentation that feels concrete, rigorous, and immediately applicable.
